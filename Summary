This SQL code performs three main operations:

1. Table Creation:
It creates a table called Students with three columns:

ID (an integer identifier)

Name (a text field storing the student's name)

Age (an integer storing the student's age)



2. Data Insertion:
The script inserts three rows with sample student data into the Students table.


3. Data Retrieval:
Finally, it retrieves all rows from the Students table using the SELECT * statement, which returns the full content of the table.



The output is a simple table showing each studentâ€™s ID, name, and age.
